## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### Let me introduce myself

My name's Leana and I'm an always learning programmer from Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª \
I just recently started this journey and aspire to create applications that will help others as well ğŸ‘¥

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a Quest system to help motivate you to do all of the boring tasks by rewarding you with XP.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program in C#.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also love to play guitar during my free time.
